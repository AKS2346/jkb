\chapter{Preface}
{T}{his book took me five years to write}, and five years to get published. I wanted to thank all those people who helped me but especially Bob, and Bill and Shiela and Tony.  Without whose pizza, I never would have gained the 20 pounds that have over the last 6 months.  Those pounds were my inspriation to sit and not go outside and instead lay in bed and think about this book.  

It is during those times that I thought about more pizza and sometimes cake.  And also all the good things my mother gave me when I was growing up in Panipat.  Though at that time, there was no pizza there.  For that I have to thank Bob and Bill and a bit of Tony who really introduced me to Pizza in the 70s long after I left Panipat. 

While we were in England I thought I was going to be influenced by Charles who was an Oxford Man and had no time for pizza. Instead he insisted on feeding me things like Stilton cheese and fine port wine.  That too was enjoyable but I gained no where enough weight to sit in my bed and contemplate writing and publishing. And so that plan was no good and I had to come to America to meet Bob and Bill and eventually Tony who really put the cap on everything.
