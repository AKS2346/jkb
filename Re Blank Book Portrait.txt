Hi Anil

Thanks for saving them in folders. I am working on 4 projects simultaneously at snail’s 
pace. 

Please make 4 folders. 

1. Who Are We? 

2. 40 Kilograms 

3. Hindi Poems book. Title
???? ?????? 
Life Journey

4. English Poems book. It has several original English poems and several translations of 
Hindi poems. This is not replacing 
   ???? ??????
Life Journey  
The 4th one is complete. It needs formatting into book style. Cover page is final and you 
have it. 
Other 3 are under construction. 

When I send you anything to save, I will title them in one of the 4 books.
 Number 3 is complete and needs finished. Please format that in your soft ware and then 
we can submit them to Lulu.com for publication on demand. And Amazon for E book only. 
Amazon does not print Hindi books. 
Other3–1,2 and 4 are for you to save them at this time. 

Thanks a lot

I have saved it.  A few questions uncle.  How many book projects are there. I am 
getting confused as to which is which and want to make sure I have them separate. 
 
First there is the “40” book. That was from last year. 
 
Second, there is the hindi poems that you have worked on “Journey” 
 
And now 
 
Third there is this book? “Life Journey”  Is this is a translation, a replacement of the 
last one that was all in hindi?
 
Anil.
