Dr. Juginder Luthra completed his MBBS from Medical College, Amritsar in
1966, and his M.S. in Ophthalmology from the Post Graduate Institute of
Medical Education and Research (PGI), Chandigarh in 1970. He moved to
Nottingham, UK along with his wife, Dolly — a dentist from the Amritsar
Dental College — and a daughter, Namita. They were blessed with twin
daughters, Rohini and Rashmi, in May 1975. The family moved to Weirton,
West Virginia, USA in June 1975. Now their three loving daughters are
married to wonderful sons-in-law, and they are blessed with six glorious
loving grandchildren.
